          <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
          <p className="mt-3">
            This website is run by {site.name} (&ldquo;ZenPen&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;),
            which is responsible — the{" "}
            <em>data controller</em>, in the language of the law below — for the personal information
            described in this policy. You can reach us by email at{" "}
            <a href={contact.email.href} className="font-semibold text-brand-ink underline">

          <h2>2. What we collect</h2>
          <h3 className="mt-4">Information you choose to give us</h3>
          <p className="mt-3">
            This site has two separate forms, for two separate reasons. The <strong>order request form</strong> in
            the Contact section is for a specific enquiry: it collects your <strong>name</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>email address</strong>, <strong>phone number</strong>, the category you&apos;re shopping for
            and any further details you add (items, sizes, colours, budget). Your name and a category are required; you
            need to give us either an email address or a phone number (or both) so we have a way to reply.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            The shorter <strong>&ldquo;insider list&rdquo;</strong> signup in the footer is not tied to
            any specific enquiry — it just lets us keep in touch with people who are interested in
            ZenPen, so it only asks for your name (optional) and one way to reach you (email or
            WhatsApp number). Submitting it is how you opt in to hearing from us this way; you can opt out
            at any time by telling us on WhatsApp or by email.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            If you message us on WhatsApp, call, or email us directly instead of using a form, the same
            principles apply to whatever you choose to share with us.
          </p>
          <h3 className="mt-4">Information collected automatically</h3>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Like effectively every website, our hosting provider keeps standard technical server logs (such
            as IP address, browser type, and the pages requested) to keep the site secure and working. This
            site does not use cookies, analytics, or advertising trackers of its own.

          <h2>3. How we use it, and why that&apos;s allowed</h2>
          <p className="mt-3">
            We use request-form information only to respond to your enquiry and to fulfil the order
            you&apos;ve asked about. We use &ldquo;insider list&rdquo; information only to occasionally
            let you know about new products, drops and offers from ZenPen. We rely on two legal grounds: your{" "}
            <strong>consent</strong> — you choose to submit a form or message us — and, for the request
            form, our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in running a responsive business, which we
            balance against your right to privacy. We do not use your details for marketing you
            haven&apos;t asked for, and we do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to anyone.

          <h2>4. Who sees it</h2>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Your information is seen only by the people at Zen Pen Enterprise who need it to respond to
            you. If you contact us through WhatsApp, that message is also handled under{" "}

            We keep your information only for as long as it&apos;s useful for the reason you gave it to us
            — generally, no longer than 24 months after your last contact with us — and then delete or
            anonymise it, unless we&apos;re required to keep it longer by law or need it to resolve a
            dispute.
